# Trainning_Word_Embeddings_Skip_Grams_Sub_Sampling
 Did this project as a part of Recurrent Neural network Module in Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. Built an word embedding based on "text8 dataset". Trained the embedding weight matrix in 'skip gram' fasion an sub-sampling the common word based on their frequency. Also visulaized the word embedding space after reducing dimensionality using T-SNE method.
